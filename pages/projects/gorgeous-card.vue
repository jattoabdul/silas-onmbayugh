          <p class="description">
            Gorgeous card wanted to add new  features into the existing web and mobile app , and I was tasked with refining the existing features and finding a way to integrate new ones and making the user experience even better.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            The design problems we discovered in the existing apps presented a major barrier to adding new features. I conducted a design quality analysis to properly evaluate what should be corrected in the new design.

            <span class="descripton-number">1</span>
            <span class="sub-header">Research</span> - I started off doing a design qualitative analysis of the old app screens, revisiting the existing documentation, going through records of customer interactions and interviewing existing stakeholders. It helped me get a much better understanding of who the user was, but it still wasn&apos;t enough, so the next step was using that information to outline a few base personas and then do research to fill in our knowledge gaps.

            <span class="sub-header">Ideation:</span> - We then did a break down of the existing product, and now working with a much deeper understanding of our users, we looked back with much more focus at all the functionality that existed (or was in the roadmap) and wrote a PRD. It outlined what we wanted to keep and the areas we wanted to explore - which was also really helpful to make sure the team was on the same page.

            <span class="descripton-number">4</span>
            <span class="sub-header">Wireframes</span> - I then moved on to wireframing and building prototypes for the web and mobile. I sketched on paper first, and designed a low fidelity mockup of the apps to be tested with users.

            <span class="sub-header">Mockups</span> - After implenting the feedback collected from testing and the team was satisfied, I started with the visual design. The existing web and mobile app had many visible design flaws - from typography to the positioning of elements and after going through the process this was the end result.

            To effectively give discount on products a business sells, loyalty system should be tied to a businesses inventory system. When both the inventory and loyalty systems are synced together, a business can effectively keep it’s books up to date. Gorgeous Card loyalty system doesn’t come with an inventory system. That made it tricky to design to work with varying business types.

          <p class="description">
            During the prototyping phase, I got caught up with making the low fidelity wireframes as close to the finished products as possible and this delayed the project a little. It is principal to iteratively test the usability, flow of interaction, correct any issues, only then to move on to the aesthetics at the end.
